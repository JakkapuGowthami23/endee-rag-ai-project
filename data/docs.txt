Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.

Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing resources such as servers, storage, and databases over the internet.

Vector databases store embeddings and allow semantic similarity search instead of keyword-based search.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves AI responses by retrieving relevant documents before generating answers.
